Pretty sure you meant http://chainofpositivity.org

The chain of positivity is about the physical paper chains people make

Would be great to get at least 100

We were going to have a scale so each link was equivalent to a certain number of metres

The chains will be submitted as photos hopefully via social media or email unless they can submit them straight to part of the site
